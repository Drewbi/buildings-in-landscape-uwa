    "text": "The Five Lamps of Learning mosaic is set in the Lunette above the five windows to the Senate Room.  The five figures in the mosaic, also known as the The Five Wise Virgins represent five of the seven virtues of wisdom: Sapienta (wisdom), Intellectus (understanding), Consilium (counsel), Fortitudo (courage), and Scientia (knowledge). Their names appear in the arches at the top of the windows to the Senate Room.  The five figures hold lighted lamps and reflect the University’s motto ‘Seek Wisdom’.  They are contrasted with the five Unwise Virgins in the background with unlit lamps bowed in poses that express the idea of dejection.\n\nThe mosaic was the first major art work to be commissioned for Winthrop Hall with funds from the Hackett Bequest.  Rodney Alsop commissioned artist Mervyn Napier Waller to design and produce the mosaic in 1931.  The mosaic is Byzantine in style.",

    "text": "At its highest point, the Winthrop Hall tower measures fourty six meters.  With 360 degree views, it offers the best aspects of the campus.  The Tower is a landmark which identifies the University Campus from many distant parts of Perth and the Swan River.  There are one hundred and eighty four steps to the top.  A Melbourne company, Messrs Ingran Bros installed the first clock in 1929.  The dial of ‘opus sectile’, an enamel finish on tile, matches the rondels above the windows on the Administration Building.  After 1945 Ennis and Sons rebuilt the master clock.  The dial was replaced in 1953 with glazed terracotta tiles."

    "title": "Winthrop Hall, Windows and Frieze",
    "text": "Winthrop Hall, like the other Hackett buildings, is constructed in reinforced concrete and brick, clad to walls with local stone quarried from various sites, cut smooth or rusticated.  Sandstone from Donnybrook was used for the columns of the galleries on the east and west sides and for some areas around doors and window.  Tamala (coastal) limestone from Coogee was used to face the external walls.  The windows of the hall are glazed with coloured glass.  Rodney Alsop designed the glazed terra cotta frieze (faience) that circles the building just under the roof eaves in alternating motives of the Winged Lion and the Lyre, the Winged Lion for the Arts and the Lyre for Music.   Alsop left no clue in his writing to explain this frieze, except to allude to a ‘Greek’ influence.  The frieze resembles a frieze surviving at an ancient Greek sanctuary at Didyma near Ephesus, now in Turkey.  It expressed Greek Gods Artemis the Huntress and Apollo."

The architectural firm Forbes and Partners were responsible for the final design.  The inscription on the seat, “verily by beauty it is that we come at wisdom” was taken from Robert Bridge’s Testament of Beauty.  A companion Memorial Seat for Vice-Chancellor H.E. Whitfeld was erected opposite on the west end of the Reflection Pool in 1949."

To architects Rodney H. Alsop and Conrad H. Sayce, Perth’s Mediterranean – like climate suggested Italy and Greece as natural inspiration for the architecture of Winthrop Hall.  Sicilian and early Christian buildings informed the design of Winthrop Hall’s upper colonnade, especially its carved capitals; its tower recalled the campaniles of the Italian Renaissance; and Venetian – style mosaic insets and Byzantine winged beasts embellished the exterior. There has been alteration to Winthrop Hall since 1932: the Undercroft has been enclosed with glass walling, the installation of the organ and a lift, upgrading of lighting, air conditioning, and  replacement of the original jarrah panelling to the Hall with veneered plywood with University shields mounted above.\n\nKnown for its iconic clock tower, Winthrop Hall is the centre of university life.  At the end of their studies, students dress in full academic regalia for their graduation ceremony here.  The hall also hosts a variety of events from lectures and concerts, to balls and exhibitions."

The building had a flat roof, accessible by stairs until 1961.  The roof became a gathering place for students during summer school and the Festival of Perth.  In 1946, alterations to the kitchen and Refectory were carried out and in 1961, a new wing designed by Architect Marshall Clifton was erected to the east to create a central courtyard.  Hackett Hall is used by the student body and the original Refectory is still in use."

The plan reoriented the campus to the north – south alignment that dominates today.  This spine established the three major open spaces:  The Court of Honour named by Alsop (Whitfeld Court), The Great Court, and James Oval.  Dr W Somerville promoted the concept that the area of land bounded on the north by Stirling Highway, on the south by Winthrop Hall, on the east by Hackett Hall, and on the west by the Administration Building to be named “Whitfeld Court”, so named by Senate in September 1940."
